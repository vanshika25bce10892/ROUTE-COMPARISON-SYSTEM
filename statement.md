1. Challenge Overview Individuals frequently face difficulties in determining the superior travel route, as
various paths present distinct distances, fuel usages, time commitments, and overall expenses.
 Manuallyassessing all these variables is time-consuming and susceptible to inaccuracies.
 There exists a demand for astraightforward tool that can compute fuel requirements, travel duration, and total expenses for multiple
routes, enabling users to select the most optimal choice.
2. Project Scope The initiative centersaround developing a fundamental route evaluation tool utilizing programming principles. The system will: •
Gather distance, fuel efficiency, fuel cost, and speed as inputs. • Determine the fuel necessary, total trip cost,
and estimated duration for each route. • Compare two routes concerning their cost and time. • Present the
superior (more economical and/or quicker) route. Scope Constraints: • Absence of real-time traffic
information. • No GPS or mapping features. • Comparison limited to two routes.
 3. Intended Users
This project is beneficial for: • Pupils and regular commuters • Individuals evaluating routes for travel •
Delivery personnel • Anyone organizing a trip looking to minimize expenses or time • Individuals learning
programming and logical reasoning
 4. Key Features Distance Entry Module – User inputs the
distance for each route Fuel Assessment – Determines fuel necessary based on mileage Cost Assessment –
Calculates total travel expenses utilizing fuel price Time Calculation – Estimates time using average speed
Route Evaluation – Displays which route is less expensive and quicker User-Centric Output – Clear and
comprehensible results
